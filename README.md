-------------------------
This directory contains all the files needed to reproduce our website. 'SQL_files' 
is all that is needed to reproduce our database, while 'PHP_src' will build the web
interface. If you have any questions, please email danwakeem@gmail.com for website
questions and matthewsherwood@my.unt.edu for database questions.

-------------------------
**Special note**
-------------------------
To use the web interface, load the database from the demo_site_database_dump.sql
file. The featured_pictures attribute for the products wont show up correctly
as we made a structured path that represents how the images would have been stored, 
though we didn't have enough pictures for every product.
