This directory contains all the files needed to reproduce our website. 'sql' is
all that is needed to reproduce our database, while 'php' will build the web
interface (albeit without any data). If you have any questions, please email
danwakeem@gmail.com for website questions and matthewsherwood@my.unt.edu for
database questions.
