-------------------------
This directory contains all the files needed to reproduce our website. 'SQL_files' 
is all that is needed to reproduce our database, while 'PHP_src' will build the web
interface. If you have any questions, please email danwakeem@gmail.com for website questions and matthewsherwood@my.unt.edu for database questions.

-------------------------
**Special note**
-------------------------
If you would like to play with the web interface make sure to use the database from
the demo_site_database_dump.sql. Because in the featured_pictures attribute for the
products wont show up correctly on the site because we just had our group members
make a structured path that represents how the images would have been stored that 
way we didn't all have to make pictures for each product. We made just enough to 
show off in class. So if you try to run on our sql files put together then you 
might get some errors on the web interfase.
