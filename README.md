#Hey there team,

## Our project is going to be mighty cool! :)

For now just the sql file containing the tables from the project will be on here
but in the future I will add the PHP files that will make up our web interface.

### What we have so far
* ecom.sql
* footer/header.php
  * This is just a footer and header that goes on every page. I always put them in their own file so I dont have to write the same thing over and over.
* login.php
  * This is the interfase where the user enters in their password and username (I know it says email right now but it is just because I am reusing code and I am lazy.
* dbConnect.php
  * This file makes the connection to the database over the internets
* checklogin.php
  * This is where what the user entered in on the login.php page is check against the database. There is a slight problem when the user enters in something that is not in the database but I will fix that later.
* login_success.php
  * This is just a crappy little page the user is sent to after they login sucessfully :)

### What is coming soon

* index.php
* shopping_page.php
* search.php

Good luck gang,
Dan Jarvis
