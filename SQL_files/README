-------------------------
This section has directories that are structured after the ER diagram and each
section should have its own README if needed. Add your information in a similar
style with the same code style. In fact, it might be easier to copy somebody
else's file and replace their information with your own.

The initialize_table file will call all of the sql files in the directories so
check to make sure your submissions will work with it. Make sure to check the
product_orders folder.



//----DONALD AND KAI----\\
Remember to write your reviews! They're still missing.

//----DAN----\\
I've placed some of your files in the miscellaneous folder in case they need to
be restored or they serve a purpose I don't understand. Move them wherever as
needed.
