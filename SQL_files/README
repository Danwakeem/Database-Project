-------------------------
This section has directories that are structured after the ER diagram and each
section should have its own README if needed. The initialize_table.sql file will
create the database and call all of the SQL files in their directories. The
miscellaneous folder contains a table dump and information pertaining to the
website.

I've placed some of your files in the miscellaneous folder in case they need to
be restored or they serve a purpose I don't understand. Move them wherever as
needed.
